This is a draft for an open-source, non-commerical implementation of 2D game engine targeted at AD&D-like rule set.
We expect that it will be cross-platform and not without Infinity Engine spirit.
It is in no way cross-path GemRB project as we do not intend to rebuild original game expirience.

Currently we use:
* C# .NET Core 1.0
* OpenTK
